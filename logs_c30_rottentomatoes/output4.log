Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /home/jli265/projects/lamp_with_ir_match/models/bert-base-finetuned-rotten_tomatoes and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- bert.pooler.dense.weight: found shape torch.Size([768, 768]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([30000, 768]) in the model instantiated
- bert.pooler.dense.bias: found shape torch.Size([768]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([30000]) in the model instantiated
- classifier.weight: found shape torch.Size([2, 768]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([2, 30000]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
